 |   An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
 |   is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
 |   is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
 |   conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 |
 |   The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
 |   any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
 |   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
 |   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
 |   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
 |   future as another exception but one is not currently available.

 |
 |   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
 |   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
 |   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
 |   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
 |   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
 |   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
 |   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
 |   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
 |   Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
 |   module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.
 |
 |   Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
 |   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
 |   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
 |   gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
 |   exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
 |   carries forward this exception.
